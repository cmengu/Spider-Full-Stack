## Phase 1: Skeleton

**Goal:** Get both servers running and talking to each other before writing any real logic. Always have a working app at every stage.

### What was built

- Monorepo structure with `backend/` and `frontend/` under the project root
- Flask app on port 5001 with a single `GET /spider` returning a hardcoded `[]`
- Vite + React app on port 5173
- Root `package.json` with `concurrently` wiring up `npm run dev` to start both servers with one command
- Vite dev proxy forwarding `/api/*` → Flask, stripping the `/api` prefix before it reaches Flask

### Folder structure at end of Phase 1

│   ├── vite.config.js
│   └── package.json
├── package.json         # root — concurrently
└── .gitignore
```

### Decisions made

**`.gitignore` created first before any installs**
`venv/`, `__pycache__/`, `node_modules/`, `.env` were gitignored before `pip install` or `npm install` ran so nothing sensitive was ever staged.

**Flask on port 5001, not 5000**
macOS AirPlay Receiver occupies port 5000 by default. Flask is started on 5001 to avoid the conflict.

**Plain `venv` inside `backend/`, not conda**
pip was coming from miniconda base. A plain `python3 -m venv backend/venv` was used instead to keep the project self-contained — reviewers can `pip install -r requirements.txt` without needing conda.

**venv activated via direct binary path in `concurrently`, not `source activate`**
`source venv/bin/activate` does not work reliably inside `concurrently` on zsh. The dev script calls the venv binary directly instead:
```json
"backend/venv/bin/flask --app backend/app run --port 5001"
```

**CORS configured from day 1**
`flask-cors` was wired up in `app.py` before anything else. Without it the frontend fetch would fail with a CORS error and the Phase 1 milestone could not be verified. CORS allows any localhost port using a regex to match the assignment spec (`http://localhost:*`):
```python
CORS(app, origins=[re.compile(r'http://localhost:\d+')])
```

**Vite proxy configured from day 1**
`vite.config.js` was updated with the proxy before writing any frontend fetch calls. This means the frontend always uses relative paths like `fetch('/api/spider')` and never has a hardcoded port — the Vite dev server is the single entry point.

**Flask route is `GET /spider`, not `GET /api/spider`**
The assignment spec defines the endpoint as `GET /spider`. The `/api` prefix only exists in the frontend as a proxy signal. The Vite proxy rewrites the path before forwarding to Flask — Flask never sees `/api`.

### Bugs and issues encountered

**Double `API response: []` in the browser console**
Seen as two identical log lines in DevTools. Caused by React 18 `StrictMode` which deliberately mounts every component twice in development to surface side effects. This is intentional behaviour, not a bug. It only happens in dev — never in production. `<StrictMode>` is in `main.jsx` and should be left in.

**`Import "flask_cors" could not be resolved` Pylance warning in VS Code**
VS Code's Pylance extension was using the system Python interpreter, which does not have `flask-cors` installed. Fixed by pointing VS Code to the venv interpreter: `Python: Select Interpreter` → `backend/venv/bin/python`. No code change needed — the code ran correctly throughout.

**`GET /api/spider` returning 404 on Flask**
Flask logged a 404 for `GET /api/spider`. This happened because the request was made directly to `http://localhost:5001/api/spider`, bypassing the Vite proxy. Flask only has the route `/spider` — calling it with the `/api` prefix returns 404 as expected. The correct access pattern is always through the Vite dev server on port 5173, never directly to Flask on 5001 during development.

| Caller | URL | Result |
|--------|-----|--------|
| Browser / frontend | `http://localhost:5173/api/spider` | Vite proxy strips `/api` → Flask `/spider` → 200 ✓ |
| Direct to Flask | `http://localhost:5001/spider` | 200 ✓ |
| Direct to Flask | `http://localhost:5001/api/spider` | 404 — no such route |

### Milestone achieved

- `npm run dev` from the project root starts both servers with one command
- `http://localhost:5001/spider` returns `[]` directly from Flask
- `http://localhost:5173/api/spider` returns `[]` via the Vite proxy
- Browser console at `http://localhost:5173` shows `API response: []` confirming the React `useEffect` fires, the fetch hits Flask through the proxy, and the response is received

---

## Phase 2: Data layer — `data.py` (Step 8)

**Goal:** One place owns CSV loading and cleaning. The Flask route will import this later; until then, `app.py` can still return `[]` on purpose so this step stays a **separate, verifiable commit** (per plan: do not batch with wiring `load_data()` into routes).

### What was built

- **`backend/data.py`** — `load_data() -> pd.DataFrame` reads `backend/spiderplot.csv`, validates schema, cleans rows, coerces types, returns a DataFrame ready for filtering / API column selection.
- **`backend/spiderplot.csv`** — copy of the dataset from `assignment/spiderplot.csv`. The `assignment/` tree is gitignored in this repo; the **backend copy is committed** so anyone who clones the repo gets the CSV without an extra copy step.
- **Automated tests** — `backend/tests/test_data.py`, `backend/pytest.ini`, and **`pytest==8.3.5`** in `backend/requirements.txt`. Run: `cd backend && ./venv/bin/pytest -v`.
- **`.gitignore`** — `backend/.pytest_cache/` added so pytest’s cache is not committed.

**Not in this step (deliberate):** Importing `load_data()` inside `app.py` or printing startup stats. The step-08 plan defers that to the next wiring step; adding a `[startup] Loaded … rows` line in `app.py` after `df = load_data()` is still recommended when the route is connected.

### Folder structure after Step 8 (data-related files)

```
backend/
├── app.py              # unchanged in Step 8 — still returns [] until wired
├── data.py             # load_data()
├── spiderplot.csv      # committed dataset
├── requirements.txt    # includes pytest
├── pytest.ini          # pythonpath = ., testpaths = tests
├── tests/
│   └── test_data.py
└── venv/
```

### Decisions and rationale (from Step 8 plan)

**Separate `data.py` from `app.py` (single responsibility)**  
HTTP (routes, query params, `jsonify`) stays in `app.py`; CSV semantics, types, and row hygiene stay in `data.py`. That way cleaning logic is testable with **pytest only**, without a Flask test client.

**Path-independent CSV path — `Path(__file__).parent / 'spiderplot.csv'`**  
A path like `'backend/spiderplot.csv'` depends on the process **current working directory**. If someone runs Flask from `backend/` vs repo root, a relative path breaks. Resolving from `__file__` is **zero CWD dependency**: the CSV always sits next to `data.py`.

**Explicit copy: `assignment/spiderplot.csv` → `backend/spiderplot.csv`**  
The plan calls out that “copy the file” must be a real subtask, not a vague note. The app’s contract is “CSV next to `data.py` in `backend/`.” Also decided to just put the csv file in the root folder because its jsut one file, if there are multiple i will create a data folder instead. 

**Fail-fast schema check — `REQUIRED_COLUMNS - set(df.columns)`**  
If the CSV is swapped or renamed, failing at the top of `load_data()` with a clear `ValueError` beats a cryptic `KeyError` deep in `dropna()`.

**Strip `subject_id`, `arm`, `tumor_type` after `astype(str)`**  
Leading/trailing spaces on categorical fields cause **silent wrong filters** (empty results, no exception). Stripping all filter-relevant string columns avoids that class of bug.

**`dropna` + `to_numeric(..., errors='coerce')` + second `dropna` on numerics**  
Rows with bad or missing numbers become NaN during coercion and are dropped before assumptions (e.g. int dose) apply.

**`dose` as plain `int`, not pandas nullable `Int64`**  
Nullable `Int64` and some numpy scalars are awkward for `flask.jsonify`. After the final `dropna`, `dose` has no NaNs; **`.astype(int)`** is JSON-safe and simpler than casting only at response time.

**Type hint `-> pd.DataFrame`**  
Documents the contract for callers and IDE tooling.

**Extra CSV columns (`first_dose`, `date`, `response`) remain on the DataFrame**  
`load_data()` does **not** drop those columns; the **API route** (when implemented) should select exactly the six assignment columns. That keeps loading faithful to the file while keeping the HTTP contract explicit in one place.

**Pytest tests**  
- Integration-style checks against the real committed CSV: **58 rows**, **10 patients**, no nulls in critical columns, `dose` dtype `int64`.  
- **Unhappy path:** temporary CSV missing required columns → `ValueError` via `monkeypatch` on `CSV_PATH`.  
This matches the plan’s emphasis on fail-fast behaviour and regression safety without coupling tests to Flask.

### Verification commands

**Quick script (same idea as plan Subtask 8c):**

```bash
cd /path/to/Interview-assignment && backend/venv/bin/python3 -c "
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, 'backend')
from data import load_data
df = load_data()
print('rows:', len(df), 'patients:', df['subject_id'].nunique())
"
```

**Expected after cleaning:** `rows: 58`, `patients: 10` (47 empty / invalid rows removed from the raw CSV, per data inspection in the plan thread).

**Unit tests:**

```bash
cd backend && ./venv/bin/pytest -v
```

**Import note for one-off scripts:** Use `sys.path.insert(0, 'backend')` then `from data import load_data` — there is no `backend/__init__.py`, so `from backend.data import ...` is not the right pattern for a standalone snippet.

### Git checkpoint (Step 8)

First commit for this step included **`backend/data.py`** and **`backend/spiderplot.csv`** only (per plan: no `app.py` wiring in the same batch).

**Follow-up:** `pytest`, `pytest.ini`, and `backend/tests/test_data.py` were added so `cd backend && ./venv/bin/pytest -v` is repeatable before the API route consumes `load_data()`.

---

## Step 9: `GET /spider` — wire `data.py` into Flask (`app.py`)

**Goal:** Replace the Phase 1 stub with a real **`GET /spider`** that reads the cleaned DataFrame from **`load_data()`**, accepts **`arms`**, **`doses`**, and **`tumor_types`** as comma-separated query parameters, validates them against values **derived from the loaded data**, and returns JSON that matches the assignment contract (six columns only, correct types, sensible HTTP errors).

### What was built

- **Startup load** — `df = load_data()` once at import time (inside `try`/`except` with a short printed hint if the CSV is missing, then re-raise). Startup logs print row count, patient count, and sorted **`VALID_*`** sets for quick sanity checks.
- **Query parameters** — `arms`, `doses`, `tumor_types` are optional; each may list multiple values separated by commas. Filters are applied in sequence on the same working **`filtered`** slice (logical AND across dimensions).
- **Validation** — Unknown arms, doses, or tumor types return **400** with **`jsonify({'error': '...'})`**. Dose tokens that are not valid integers after stripping return **400** (`Doses must be integers`). Valid filters that match no rows return **200** with **`[]`** (empty intersection is not an error).
- **Response shape** — Exactly six fields per object: `subject_id`, `arm`, `days`, `change`, `dose`, `tumor_type`. Extra columns from the CSV (`first_dose`, `date`, `response`, etc.) never appear in the payload. **`days`** is serialized as a **string** (via `astype(int).astype(str)`). **`change`** is rounded to six decimal places for stable JSON.
- **Edge case: trailing commas and blank tokens** — Tokens are parsed with `if segment.strip()` so natural typos like `?arms=A,` or `?doses=1800,` do not produce empty entries, spurious **400**s, or `int('')`. If every token is empty after stripping (e.g. `?arms=,`), the filter is **skipped** (same as omitting the parameter). An inner **`if arm_list:`** / **`if dose_list:`** / **`if tumor_list:`** ensures we never call **`.isin([])`**, which would incorrectly return zero rows.
- **Constants** — **`RESPONSE_COLUMNS`** is a **tuple** (fixed contract, not accidentally mutable). Pandas column indexing uses **`filtered[list(RESPONSE_COLUMNS)]`** because a **tuple of column names** in **`df[tuple]`** is interpreted as a **single MultiIndex label**, not as multiple columns.

### Decisions and rationale (Step 9 plan + follow-ups)

**Explicit `sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent))` before `from data import load_data`**  
Flask’s CLI may add the app directory to `sys.path`, but that is not something to rely on for `python app.py`, one-off scripts, or pytest importing the app module. Making the import path explicit keeps **`from data import load_data`** working from repo root, `backend/`, and tests.

**`VALID_ARMS`, `VALID_DOSES`, `VALID_TUMORS` derived from `df`, not literals**  
The set of legal filter values is a fact about the cleaned dataset. Duplicating it in `app.py` would eventually drift from `data.py`. Sets use **`str(...)`** and **`int(...)`** so membership checks use plain Python types (**`numpy.int64`** in sets is awkward for JSON and comparisons).

**`filtered = df` per request; copy only when building the response**  
The route does **not** copy the full frame on every request. Boolean indexing returns a view-backed slice; **`filtered[...].copy()`** is used only for the small result so mutating **`days`** / **`change`** does not touch the shared **`df`**.

**Tumor filter must apply `isin(tumor_list)`**  
Validating `tumor_types` but forgetting to filter the frame would return all rows — a silent, hard-to-spot bug. The plan called this out explicitly; the implementation always narrows **`filtered`** when **`tumor_list`** is non-empty.

**Error payloads use `sorted(invalid)`**  
Sets in f-strings look like Python **`{...}`** in JSON; sorting gives a predictable, API-friendly list in the message text.

**Integration verification script hygiene**  
When Flask is started in the background for curl-based checks, a bash **`trap 'kill $FLASK_PID' EXIT`** immediately after **`FLASK_PID=$!`** ensures the server is torn down on success, failed **`assert`**, or **Ctrl-C**, avoiding **“address already in use”** on the next run.

**Row counts in manual checks are dataset-dependent**  
For example, **`?tumor_types=HNSCC`** returns **every** HNSCC row in the **committed** CSV — the plan once assumed a smaller count from an older slice of the data. Verification should assert **correct filtering** (e.g. all returned rows have `tumor_type == 'HNSCC'`) and/or compare counts to **`load_data()`**, not a hard-coded row count tied to a specific CSV revision.

### Folder structure after Step 9

`backend/app.py` is the only application file that changes in this step; **`data.py`**, CSV, and tests stay as in Step 8.

```
backend/
├── app.py              # GET /spider — load_data(), filters, validation, jsonify
├── data.py
├── spiderplot.csv
├── tests/
│   └── test_data.py
└── ...
```

### Verification

**Flask test client (no server port):** import **`app`** with **`sys.path.insert(0, 'backend')`**, then **`app.test_client().get('/spider?...')`** to assert status codes, column keys, **`days`** type, and dynamic filter counts against **`app.df`**.

**Manual / plan-style checks** (from repo root, with venv):

```bash
backend/venv/bin/flask --app backend/app run --port 5001 &
FLASK_PID=$!
trap "kill $FLASK_PID 2>/dev/null" EXIT
until curl -s http://localhost:5001/spider > /dev/null 2>&1; do sleep 0.3; done

curl -s "http://localhost:5001/spider" | python3 -c "import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); assert len(d)==58"
curl -s "http://localhost:5001/spider?arms=Z" -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n"   # expect 400
curl -s "http://localhost:5001/spider?arms=A&doses=3000" | python3 -c "import sys,json; assert json.load(sys.stdin)==[]"
```

Existing data tests still apply: **`cd backend && ./venv/bin/pytest -v`**.

### Git checkpoint (Step 9)

Commit **`backend/app.py`** after the route matches the contract (Step 9 plan: do not batch with the next frontend milestone unless the roadmap says otherwise).

---

## Step 10: Manual curl verification

**Goal:** Confirm the live Flask server behaves identically to what the unit tests assert — same filters, same status codes, same JSON shape — before moving to the frontend.

### What was built

No new files. Step 9's bash verification script covers this entirely. Step 10 is complete when Step 9's 8-check script passes.

### Why this step exists at all

Unit tests run the route **in-process** via Flask's test client. Manual curl hits the **real server over a real socket**. They should agree — but occasionally they don't. Flask's test client bypasses WSGI middleware, OS-level socket limits, and CORS headers. A 2-minute curl pass catches the class of bug that only shows up when a real HTTP connection is involved.

### Decisions and rationale

**`trap "kill $FLASK_PID 2>/dev/null" EXIT` immediately after backgrounding Flask**  
Without a trap, any failing `assert` exits the script and leaves Flask running on port 5001. The next verification run then fails immediately with `OSError: address already in use`. The trap fires on **any** exit — success, failed assertion, Ctrl-C — so the port is always released.

**Poll until ready instead of `sleep 2`**  
```bash
until curl -s http://localhost:5001/spider > /dev/null 2>&1; do sleep 0.3; done
```
A fixed `sleep 2` is fragile: slow machines or cold venv startups may not be ready in time. Polling exits the moment Flask responds — faster on fast machines, safe on slow ones.

**Count assertions should compare filter correctness, not hardcoded numbers**  
An earlier draft asserted `?tumor_types=HNSCC` returns 5 rows. The real data has 31 HNSCC rows across 5 patients. Hardcoding row counts ties the verification to a specific CSV snapshot. The safer pattern is: assert all returned rows have `tumor_type == 'HNSCC'` (correctness), plus optionally cross-check count against `load_data()` at runtime rather than a constant.

### Milestone

All 8 curl checks pass: full dataset (58 rows), column set (6 keys), `days` type (string), arm filter, tumor filter, invalid arm (400), invalid dose (400), empty intersection (200 with `[]`).

---

## Step 11: pytest tests for `GET /spider`

**Goal:** Catch silent regressions in the route logic — validation, filtering, response shape, state isolation — without relying on a running server or the contents of the real CSV.

### What was built

- **`backend/tests/conftest.py`** — `sample_df` fixture (5 rows, 3 patients) and a `client` fixture that replaces the module-level `df` and all `VALID_*` sets with fixture-derived values for every test.
- **`backend/tests/test_api.py`** — 28 tests across 7 groups: response contract, filter correctness, input validation, edge cases, combined filters, state isolation, security.

### What the Flask test client actually does

`client.get('/spider?arms=Z')` does **not** start a server or open a socket. It calls the Flask app **in-process**, passing a fake WSGI request object directly to the routing layer. The `spider()` function runs exactly as it would under a real HTTP request — `request.args`, validation, pandas filtering, `jsonify` — and returns a response object the test can inspect.

This means every test is testing **`app.py` logic**: the split-strip-validate-filter-select pipeline. What varies is which branch of that pipeline each test exercises.

### Why `sample_df` instead of the real CSV

The real `df` has 58 rows. If `assert len(r.get_json()) == 32` breaks because a new patient was added to the CSV, the test suite has become a test of the *dataset*, not the *route logic*. `test_data.py` already covers data integrity against the real CSV; `test_api.py` should cover route behaviour.

`sample_df` is 5 rows you define. The counts are facts you control — they never drift. When `?arms=A` asserts 3 rows, a broken filter returning 5 is immediately caught, not masked by a coincidentally correct count.

**Why 5 rows, not 3:** With 3 rows a broken filter returning "all rows" and a working filter returning "correct rows" can produce the same count by coincidence. The 5-row fixture is structured so every filter has a unique expected count:

| Filter | Expected rows | What it catches if wrong |
|---|---|---|
| `?arms=A` | 3 | Filter returning all 5 |
| `?arms=B` | 2 | Filter returning all 5 |
| `?tumor_types=HNSCC` | 2 | The original missing-filter-line bug |
| `?arms=A&doses=3000` | 0 | AND logic failing |

### Why the `client` fixture patches `VALID_*` too — not just `df`

`VALID_ARMS`, `VALID_DOSES`, `VALID_TUMORS` are derived from `df` **at import time** — once, before any test runs. Patching only `df` leaves the validation sets pointing at the real CSV's values. The fixture data happens to use the same arms and doses as the real data, so tests pass — but for the wrong reason. If you needed a test row with `arm='C'` to verify validation rejects unknown values, the real `VALID_ARMS = {'A','B'}` would intercept it, not the fixture-derived one.

Patching all four attributes makes the test hermetic: the route sees exactly the DataFrame and validation sets the fixture defines, nothing from the real CSV.

### Why the simple approach (real CSV) is also valid for this take-home

The more complex fixture setup is correct in principle. But for a fixed 58-row CSV that never changes during the project, testing against real data with known counts is also defensible — and simpler to explain in the presentation:

> *"I tested against the real data with counts I verified during data inspection. The CSV is fixed for this take-home, so count assertions won't drift."*

The fixture approach is worth knowing because it shows you understand **test isolation** and **what you're actually testing**. The real-data approach is worth knowing because it shows **pragmatism**. Be ready to argue either direction.

### Decisions and rationale

**`import app as app_module` at the top of conftest, not inside the fixture**  
Module-level import makes the side effect (CSV load, startup prints) visible and explicit. Inside-fixture import hides it and implies the module is imported fresh per test — it isn't; Python caches module imports.

**`sys.path.insert` not needed in conftest**  
`pytest.ini` at `backend/pytest.ini` has `pythonpath = .`, which adds `backend/` to `sys.path` automatically. An explicit `sys.path.insert` in conftest is redundant and signals you don't know where the path is actually coming from.

**Test the assumption violations, not just the happy path**  
Every route has implicit assumptions. The tests are organised around violating those assumptions:

| Assumption the code makes | Test that violates it |
|---|---|
| Arms are case-sensitive | `?arms=a` → expect 400, not empty array |
| Dose tokens are parseable as int | `?doses=1800.5` → expect 400 |
| Flask takes first value for duplicate params | `?arms=A&arms=B` → only Arm A rows returned |
| Boolean indexing never mutates `df` | Check `len(app.df)` unchanged after a filtered request |
| Injection strings fail validation, not pandas | SQL injection → 400, not 500 |

**The one test that catches the original code's bug**  
```python
def test_tumor_type_filter_actually_filters(client):
    r = client.get('/spider?tumor_types=HNSCC')
    assert len(r.get_json()) == 2   # not 5 — proves filter ran
```
The original `app.py` draft validated `tumor_types` then forgot to apply the filter. This test fails immediately on the broken code and passes on the fix. A happy-path test that only checks `status_code == 200` would have missed it entirely.

**State isolation tests**  
```python
def test_df_not_mutated_after_filtered_request(client, sample_df):
    client.get('/spider?arms=A')
    assert len(app_module.df) == len(sample_df)  # still 5

def test_consecutive_requests_are_independent(client):
    client.get('/spider?arms=A')
    r2 = client.get('/spider')
    assert len(r2.get_json()) == 5  # not 3
```
These tests verify that `filtered = df` (a reference, not a copy) never writes back to `df`. If someone changed `filtered = df` to `filtered = df.copy()` and then accidentally assigned `df = filtered` after filtering, these tests catch it.

**Security tests return 400, not 500**  
SQL injection and XSS strings are not in `VALID_ARMS` or `VALID_TUMORS`. They hit the validation layer and return 400 before the injection string ever reaches pandas. A 500 would mean the validation was bypassed — the injection reached a pandas operation that crashed on unexpected input, which is worse than a clean 400.

## Phase 3: Frontend data pipeline (Steps 12–16)

**Goal:** Build the frontend data layer before writing any UI. The API returns flat rows — one row per patient per timepoint. Plotly needs per-patient trace objects. This phase writes the pure transformation function that bridges the two, locks its behaviour with a Vitest suite, and separates rendering constants from data logic before Phase 5 makes everything visual.

### What was built

| File | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| `frontend/vite.config.js` | Added `test.environment: 'jsdom'`; removed stale `// flag` comment from proxy block |
| `frontend/package.json` | `react-router-dom`, `react-plotly.js`, `plotly.js`; dev: `vitest`, `@vitest/coverage-v8`; `"test": "vitest run"` |
| `frontend/src/constants.js` | `COLOR_MAP` — arm+dose string → hex color; single import point for Phase 5 and 6 |
| `frontend/src/utils/transformData.js` | `buildPatientSeries(rows)` — groups flat API rows into per-patient DTOs with `colorKey` and sorted `points` |
| `frontend/src/utils/transformData.test.js` | 13 Vitest tests covering grouping, metadata, type coercion, baseline injection, sort order, edge cases, and `colorKey` correctness |

```

### Decisions and rationale

**`groupBySubject` renamed to `buildPatientSeries`**
The original draft named the function `groupBySubject` but it does three things: groups rows by patient, injects a synthetic baseline point, and sorts both points and patients. The name was a lie — it implied a simple grouping operation when the function also injects domain-specific data and sorts. `buildPatientSeries` accurately describes the output: a series of patient objects ready for Plotly.

**`COLOR_MAP` moved out of `transformData.js` into `constants.js`**
The first draft exported `COLOR_MAP` from `transformData.js`. A transform module has no business knowing about hex colors — that is a rendering concern. More practically, `COLOR_MAP` is also consumed by `FilterPanel` (Phase 6) for legend rendering. If it lived in `transformData.js`, Phase 6 would import a rendering constant from a data module, creating a coupling that makes refactoring harder. `constants.js` is the single source of truth for all app-wide rendering constants.

**`colorKey` computed once in `buildPatientSeries`, stored on the patient object**
Each patient in the output carries a `colorKey` field: `` `ARM ${row.arm} ${row.dose} mg` ``. This matches `COLOR_MAP`'s key format exactly. Without this, `SpiderPlot` (Phase 5) would have to reconstruct the key string inline every time it renders a trace. That reconstruction is untestable in the transform suite — if the arm field format ever changed (e.g. `'A'` → `'Arm A'`), the chart would silently render with no colors and no error. Computing `colorKey` once in the transform and verifying it against `COLOR_MAP` in tests catches this class of bug before the chart exists.

**O(n+m) baseline injection, not O(n×m)**
The original baseline check used `rows.some(r => r.subject_id === patient.subject_id && Number(r.days) === 0)` inside the per-patient `forEach`. For each patient, this scans all rows — O(patients × rows). The correct approach builds a `Set` of day-zero subject IDs in one O(n) pass before the patient loop, then does O(1) `.has()` lookups per patient. Total: O(rows + patients). For 10 patients and 58 rows it makes no practical difference, but O(n×m) is the wrong algorithm when O(n+m) is trivial.

**Baseline check uses `Number(r.days) === 0` not `p.weeks === 0`**
After division (`days / 7`), exact float equality against `0` is technically fine for integer day values (`0 / 7 === 0`), but it is fragile — a future CSV with fractional-day entries could produce `0.001 / 7 = 0.000143`, which would fail the equality check and cause double-baseline injection. Checking the raw integer days value before division is the source of truth. The question the code is answering is "did a real day-0 measurement exist in the data?" — checking `r.days`, not the derived `p.weeks`, is the correct place to ask it.

**`vitest environment: jsdom`, not `node`**
Pure utility functions like `buildPatientSeries` have no browser API calls and could run in either environment. `node` was tempting because it is technically correct for today's tests and marginally faster. It was rejected because Phase 9 ("fill out remaining Vitest edge cases") will add component tests — those need `jsdom` for DOM access. Setting `node` now means either changing the global config later (one migration step) or adding `// @vitest-environment jsdom` at the top of every future component test file (boilerplate forever). `jsdom` works for both utility and component tests at zero cost today.

**`react-plotly.js` + `plotly.js` over a lighter chart library**
The assignment spec calls for a spider plot. Plotly has native support for the exact chart type, reference lines, hovertemplate, and responsive sizing the spec requires. A lighter library like recharts would require building those features manually. For a take-home where time is the constraint, Plotly is the right call despite the ~3 MB bundle size.

**`@vitest/coverage-v8` installed but not enforced**
Coverage is not part of Phase 3's success criteria. It is installed now so `--coverage` is available if needed later without a separate install step.

### Why `buildPatientSeries` outputs `points` as a separate array

The API returns flat rows. Plotly needs two parallel arrays per trace: `x` (weeks) and `y` (change). Storing both as `{weeks, change}` objects in a `points` array keeps the transform output self-contained — the chart component extracts x and y with two `.map()` calls:

```js
x: patient.points.map(p => p.weeks),
y: patient.points.map(p => p.change),
```

The remaining fields — `arm`, `dose`, `tumor_type`, `colorKey`, `subject_id` — are metadata consumed by the filter panel, legend, hover tooltip, and patient count display. They never go into Plotly's `x`/`y` arrays. The shape was designed so each concern reads exactly what it needs and ignores the rest.

### Test suite design — what was wrong with the first draft and why

The first draft had 7 tests. After two rounds of senior review, the suite was expanded to 13. Changes made:

**Fixed: syntax error in `withDayZero` fixture**
The double-baseline test had an incomplete object literal — the file would fail to parse entirely, silently skipping the test and giving false confidence.

**Fixed: magic strings replaced with named constants**
`'08-201'`, `'08-202'`, `'08-203'` scattered across multiple tests were extracted to `S1`, `S2`, `S3` constants. A typo in one fixture row now fails at the constant definition, not silently at a `.find()` returning `undefined`.

**Fixed: sort test was an indirect self-comparison**
The original `expect(weeks).toEqual([...weeks].sort((a, b) => a - b))` checks "is the output sorted?" but not "are the values correct?". A function returning wrong week values in sorted order would pass. Replaced with explicit expected values: `expect(weeks[0]).toBe(0)`, `expect(weeks[1]).toBeCloseTo(47 / 7)`, `expect(weeks[2]).toBeCloseTo(101 / 7)`.

**Added: patient structure test (not just count)**
The original `toHaveLength(2)` only verified count. A function returning `[null, null]` would pass. Added `toMatchObject` asserting all five fields — `subject_id`, `arm`, `dose`, `tumor_type`, `colorKey` — are present and correct on the patient object.

**Added: metadata field correctness for each patient**
No test verified that `arm`, `dose`, `tumor_type` were correctly assigned. A grouping bug that swapped patient metadata would pass the entire original suite. Added a dedicated test asserting S2's metadata is `arm: 'B'`, `dose: 3000`, `tumor_type: 'HNSCC'`.

**Added: dose type coercion test**
`Number(row.dose)` is in the code specifically because the API could return dose as a string. No test asserted `typeof patient.dose === 'number'`. If that coercion broke, Phase 5 would receive string doses and the sort comparator `a.dose - b.dose` would silently return `NaN`, breaking patient ordering.

**Added: single-timepoint patient test**
No test covered a patient with exactly one real measurement. After baseline injection, they should have exactly two points. Without this test, an off-by-one in the injection logic could produce a patient with only a baseline and no measurements — visually a dot, not a line.

**Added: `colorKey` → `COLOR_MAP` cross-check**
`buildPatientSeries` produces `colorKey` values. `COLOR_MAP` in `constants.js` is what `SpiderPlot` will look up. Without a test that imports both and asserts `COLOR_MAP[patient.colorKey]` is defined, a typo in either file would pass all transform tests and only fail visually in Phase 5.

### Verification

```bash
cd frontend && npm test
```

Expected output:
```
 ✓ src/utils/transformData.test.js (13)

Test Files  1 passed (1)
     Tests  13 passed (13)
```

### Git checkpoints (Phase 3)

One commit per step — do not batch:

```
step 12: install react-router-dom, plotly, vitest; jsdom env; clean proxy comment
step 13: add constants.js with COLOR_MAP
step 14: write buildPatientSeries — colorKey, O(n+m) baseline check, JSDoc
step 15: 13 vitest cases — structure, metadata, type coercion, colorKey, edge cases
docs: Phase 3 — transformData, constants, Vitest suite
```

## Phase 4: Bootstrap — Tailwind, Router, Navbar (Steps 15b–18)

**Goal:** Remove unused Vite scaffold assets, add **Tailwind CSS v4** (`@tailwindcss/vite`, `@import "tailwindcss"` as **first line** of `index.css`), mount **`BrowserRouter`** in **`main.jsx`**, declare **`/`** and **`/visualisation`** (British spelling) with **`Landing`** / **`Visualisation`** stubs, then add a persistent **`Navbar`** (`Link` + **`NavLink`** with `className={({ isActive }) => ...}`) **above** `<Routes>` in **`App.jsx`**.

### What was built

| Step | Change |
|------|--------|
| **15b** | Deleted **`App.css`**, **`assets/react.svg`**, **`assets/vite.svg`** (no imports in `src/`). **`hero.png`** removed in Phase 4 senior review pass (zero importers confirmed by grep). |
| **16** | **`tailwindcss`**, **`@tailwindcss/vite`**; **`vite.config.js`** → `plugins: [tailwindcss(), react()]`; **`index.css`** prepended with `@import "tailwindcss";` |
| **17** | **`BrowserRouter`** wraps **`App`** in **`main.jsx`**; **`App.jsx`** → `<Routes>` + stubs in **`pages/Landing.jsx`**, **`pages/Visualisation.jsx`** |
| **18** | **`components/Navbar.jsx`**; **`App.jsx`** fragment with **`<Navbar />`** then **`<Routes>`** |

### Decisions (from plan)

- **Router in `main.jsx`**, not `App.jsx`, so **`App`** stays testable with a **`MemoryRouter`** when needed.
- **`NavLink`** callback for active styling — no **`useLocation`** + manual path compare.
- **Navbar above routes** — not duplicated inside each page.
- **Plugin order** `tailwindcss()` before `react()` per Tailwind v4 convention.

### Verification

```bash
cd frontend && npm test    # 13 passed
cd frontend && npm run lint
cd frontend && npm run build
```

Browser (with **`npm run dev`**): **`/`** shows **Landing**; **`/visualisation`** shows **Visualisation**; Navbar and active link styling on both.

### Git checkpoints (Phase 4)

```
step 15b: delete Vite scaffold dead files — App.css, react.svg, vite.svg not imported anywhere
step 16: install tailwind v4, wire @tailwindcss/vite plugin, @import as first line of index.css
step 17: BrowserRouter in main.jsx, two-route App.jsx, Landing and Visualisation stubs
step 18: Navbar with NavLink isActive callback, mounted above Routes in App.jsx
```

### Steps 19–21: Landing page (phrase4 plan)

| Step | Deliverable |
|------|-------------|
| **19** | **`components/SummaryCard.jsx`** — `title` + `value`, JSDoc `@param` contract, Tailwind card, `text-left` |
| **20** | **`pages/Landing.jsx`** — `AbortController` fetch, early returns per state, `useMemo` + exported `deriveStats`, three **`SummaryCard`**s |
| **21** | **`Link`** CTA to **`/visualisation`** (`Explore Spider Plot →`) |

**Git checkpoints:** `step 19: add SummaryCard…`, `step 20: Landing — fetch…`, `step 21: CTA Link…`

Verify with backend on **5001**: cards show **10**, **A, B**, **1800mg, 3000mg**; Vitest stays **18** passed (13 transform + 5 deriveStats).

## Phase 4, Steps 19–21: Senior Review — 10 Issues Identified and Resolved

After the initial plan was drafted a senior review pass found 10 issues across CSS infrastructure, component contracts, state management, and plan process. Each is documented below: the original issue, why the naïve fix is insufficient, and the resolution actually applied.

---

### Item 1 — No `AbortController` on the fetch

**Issue:** The original `useEffect` had no cleanup function. React 18 `StrictMode` deliberately unmounts and remounts every component in development — the first fetch fires, React unmounts, React remounts, the second fetch fires. With no abort, the first fetch continues in-flight and calls `setRows` on a component instance that has been discarded.

**Why the naïve fix falls short:** Adding `AbortController` with a `finally(() => setLoading(false))` cleanup still fires `setLoading` on the abort path — calling state setters on an unmounted component, which is the exact problem being fixed. `finally` runs unconditionally; that includes the abort.

**Resolution applied:** `setLoading(false)` was moved out of `finally` into the explicit success `.then` and the non-abort `.catch` branch. The abort path returns early with no state calls. The cleanup function `() => controller.abort()` is the return value of `useEffect`.

```js
// abort path — no state calls
.catch(err => {
  if (err.name === 'AbortError') return
  setError(err.message)
  setLoading(false)
})
return () => controller.abort()
```

---

### Item 2 — Error state rendered wrong card values

**Issue:** The render used `loading ? '…' : stats.X` as the guard for card values. After a fetch failure, `loading = false` and `rows = []`, so `deriveStats([])` returned `{patients: 0, arms: '', doses: ''}`. Cards rendered `0`, empty string, empty string — wrong values with no visual error indication beyond the error message above them.

**Why the naïve fix falls short:** The three-state ternary `loading ? '…' : error ? 'N/A' : stats.X` repeated across three cards is a DRY violation embedded in JSX. Adding a fourth state later (e.g. stale data) requires touching all three cards.

**Resolution applied:** Early returns. Three explicit render branches — loading, error, success — each with a self-contained `return`. The success path has no conditional logic; `stats` is guaranteed valid. Layout shell (`<main className="px-8 py-12">`) is identical across all three branches so the page does not shift during state transitions.

---

### Item 3 — `constants/colorMap.js` path was stale in two places

**Issue:** The roadmap plan (`.claude/plans/roadmap.md`) and Claude's memory file both documented the `COLOR_MAP` file as `frontend/src/constants/colorMap.js`. The actual file created in Phase 3 was `frontend/src/constants.js`. If Phase 5 imported from `'../constants/colorMap'` it would get a module-not-found error with no obvious cause.

**Why the naïve fix falls short:** Renaming the file to match the stale doc would break the existing test import `import { COLOR_MAP } from '../constants'` and add unnecessary churn. The file is already in the right place.

**Resolution applied:** Both documents updated to `constants.js`. The file was not moved — the document was the error. File paths in design documents rot; the interface (`COLOR_MAP`, key format) is what matters to document.

---

### Item 4 — `deriveStats` not exported, not memoised, not tested

**Three separate problems that compound each other:**

**Not exported:** `deriveStats` was a module-level unexported function. No test could import it directly. Any derivation bug would only surface visually in the browser.

**Not memoised:** Called on every render. When `loading = true` and `rows = []`, it ran and allocated throwaway `Set` objects on every re-render. The dependency contract — "only recalculate when `rows` changes" — was invisible in the code.

**Not tested:** The critical edge case — `Number(r.dose)` deduplicating the string `"1800"` and the number `1800` as the same dose — had no test. If that coercion broke, the Dose Levels card would silently show `1800mg, 1800mg`.

**Resolution applied:** `deriveStats` named-exported from `Landing.jsx`. `frontend/src/pages/landing.test.js` created with five tests: patient count, arm sort, dose format, string/number dose deduplication, and empty input safe values. `useMemo(() => deriveStats(rows), [rows])` wired in the component. Tests written before the component was wired — test output was the verification that export + logic were correct. Vitest count: 13 → 18.

---

### Item 5 — Two CSS design systems not bridged

**Issue:** `index.css` defined custom CSS variables (`--text`, `--text-h`, `--border`, `--accent`). Components used Tailwind's built-in grays (`text-gray-600`, `border-gray-200`). The two systems were not synchronised — changing `--text-h` would not affect any component using `text-gray-900`.

**Why the naïve fix falls short:** "Pick one system" means either rewriting all component classes to use CSS variables (no Tailwind tooling benefit) or deleting the CSS variables (losing the dark mode override system in the existing `prefers-color-scheme` block).

**Resolution applied:** Tailwind v4's `@theme` block bridges the two without choosing either:

```css
@theme {
  --color-brand-text:    #6b6375;
  --color-brand-heading: #08060d;
  --color-brand-border:  #e5e4e7;
  --color-accent:        #aa3bff;
}
```

`text-brand-text`, `border-brand-border`, `text-brand-heading`, `text-accent` are now valid Tailwind utility classes referencing the design system values. Existing components using Tailwind grays continue to work. Phase 8 polish can migrate incrementally.

**Dark mode note:** `@theme` tokens compile to static values, not CSS variable references. Full dark mode support via Tailwind utilities would require `dark:` variants per component. For this project, dark mode is handled via the existing `prefers-color-scheme: dark` `:root` override block. The `@theme` tokens cover light mode component styling only.

---

### Item 6 — `font: 18px` on `:root` silently skewed all Tailwind `rem` values

**Issue:** `font: 18px/145% var(--sans)` in `:root` set the CSS base font size to 18px. Tailwind's default rem scale assumes `1rem = 16px`. With an 18px base: `text-sm` resolved to 15.75px, `p-6` to 27px, `gap-4` to 18px — every rem-based utility was off by 12.5%.

**Why the naïve fix falls short:** Simply changing `font-size: 18px` to `font-size: 16px` on `:root` loses the intended 18px body text size. The issue is not the size itself but where it is set: `:root` affects the `rem` scale; `body` does not.

**Resolution applied:** `font-size`, `line-height`, `font-family`, and the responsive `@media (max-width: 1024px) { font-size: 16px }` were moved from `:root` to `body`. The `:root` block retains only CSS variable declarations and rendering-hint properties (`color-scheme`, `font-synthesis`, etc.). `rem` is now based on the browser default 16px; body text is rendered at 18px.

---

### Item 7 — `text-align: center` on `#root` was implicit layout behaviour

**Issue:** The Vite scaffold default left `text-align: center` on the `#root` div. All child text centred by default — including error messages, subtitles, and the CTA button — without any visible indication in the component JSX. `SummaryCard` had `text-left` to fight this, but the override made sense only if you knew about the global rule.

**Why the naïve fix falls short:** Removing it blindly without auditing dependents causes visual regressions. The page title and subtitle were centred by this rule and needed `text-center` added explicitly before the global rule was removed.

**Resolution applied:** `text-align: center` removed from `#root`. `SummaryCard`'s `text-left` class remains (now semantically "left-align this card" rather than "override a global default"). Centering is now a visible, auditable decision in component JSX. Any future component with centred text will have `text-center` declared on it — discoverable without reading `index.css`.

---

### Item 8 — Orphaned `frontend/src/assets/hero.png`

**Issue:** Step 15b deleted `App.css`, `react.svg`, and `vite.svg`. `hero.png` was left behind with zero importers anywhere in `frontend/src/`. The step 15b plan listed specific filenames to delete rather than running a reference sweep.

**Resolution applied:** `hero.png` deleted via `git rm`. The Phase 9 cleanup step now includes a systematic sweep to catch any remaining unreferenced assets:

```bash
find frontend/src/assets -type f | while read f; do
  name=$(basename "$f")
  count=$(grep -r "$name" frontend/src --include="*.jsx" --include="*.js" -l | wc -l)
  echo "$count $name"
done
```

Files returning `0` are unreferenced. This replaces the name-based approach with a reference-based approach — more reliable as the project grows.

**Step 15b note updated:** Documentation previously recorded `hero.png` as "kept". That entry has been corrected: `hero.png` was removed in the Phase 4 senior review pass.

---

### Item 9 — `SummaryCard` had no prop type contract

**Issue:** `SummaryCard` accepted `value` as any type. Passing a number (e.g. `stats.patients`, which is `Set.size` — a `number`) would render silently. There was no signal to the caller that the contract required a `string`.

**Why the naïve fix falls short:** Removing `String(stats.patients)` at the call site is correct (React renders `{0}` as `"0"` — no casting needed for render). But removing it without documenting the prop contract just moves the ambiguity back into the component.

**Resolution applied:** JSDoc `@param {{ title: string, value: string }}` added to `SummaryCard`. Any IDE with JSDoc type checking now flags a numeric `value` at the call site. `String(stats.patients)` is kept in `Landing.jsx` as the explicit cast that satisfies the documented contract — the conversion is visible and intentional rather than implicit.

---

### Item 10 — Plan Step 21 used full-file replacement for an additive change

**Issue:** The implementation plan for Step 21 (adding the CTA `Link`) provided the complete `Landing.jsx` as a code block under "Self-Contained Rule." An agent executing the plan would overwrite the entire file. If Step 20's output had any legitimate deviation from the plan — whitespace normalisation, a wording tweak, a corrected import — Step 21 would silently revert it with the stale version from the plan document.

**Why the naïve fix falls short:** "Show only a diff" is ambiguous. A diff without context is hard for an agent to apply correctly to a file that may differ slightly from the plan.

**Resolution applied:** Step 21 in `.claude/plans/phrase4.md` updated to specify two precise Edit operations with exact `old_string` / `new_string` pairs and a uniqueness verification command for each anchor:

1. Insert `import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'` — anchor: the SummaryCard import line (verified unique before applying)
2. Insert `<Link>` JSX block — anchor: `</div>` immediately before `</main>` (verified unique in scope)

**Principle documented:** The "Self-Contained Rule" in the plan template is designed for steps that create new files or perform full rewrites. Additive steps should use Edit semantics — minimum change, verified-unique anchor, no full-file replacement.
